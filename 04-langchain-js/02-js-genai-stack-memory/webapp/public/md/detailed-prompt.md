>I’m currently engaged in a data analysis initiative that requires consistent organization of numerical datasets to enhance their clarity and facilitate comparative analysis. To optimize this aspect of my project, I seek a Python script tailored for high efficiency in sorting varying lengths of number lists in ascending order, with a particular emphasis on maintaining optimal performance even when dealing with extensive datasets. It’s critical that the script is scalable and employs a sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and speed, such as QuickSort or MergeSort, to ensure minimal performance degradation as dataset sizes increase. Additionally, I request detailed inline commentary within the script, explaining the chosen sorting algorithm’s mechanics, its computational complexity, and why it’s well-suited for handling large datasets, thereby providing insight into its application and efficiency in data analysis contexts.
